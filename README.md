error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/                                                                                                                     note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

Fix to the error above
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

installs visual studio then install the c++ thing

if that doesnt work do

pip install psutil==5.8.0 --no-build-isolation

or if that doesnt help ask chatgpt 



===================================================


**Compiling it to be a executeable**
in command prompt do

1, pip install pyinstaller

then do
[in command]
2, cd C:\Users\youruserhere\Downloads\filenameEtc
ONCE IN CD 
do
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole makethisyourscriptname.py
example
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole Susexe.py

it will then be in the "dist" folder, execute it [double click] and see the magic happen :whoa:
